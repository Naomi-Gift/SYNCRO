Self-Custodial Subscription Manager
A decentralized subscription management platform that enables users to control recurring payments directly from their own wallet. Users can track, approve, pause, and fund subscriptions like Netflix, YouTube, Claude, Midjourney, and more, without giving control of their payment method to any centralized service. Payments are executed via a crypto-card-funded agent to handle Web2 billing.

✨ Key Features
Full self-custody: users maintain complete control of funds
Unified dashboard for managing all subscriptions
AI-powered agent to automate payment approvals and execution
Crypto-to-card settlement layer for legacy services
Price-change protection with spending caps
Push notifications for approvals and reminders
Manual subscription entry for unsupported platforms
🧠 High-Level Workflow
User connects a Web3 wallet.
User adds subscriptions (auto-detected or manually entered).
User funds a Subscription Vault with USDC or stablecoins.
When a bill is due:
System sends approval request
If approved, the agent loads exact funds to a crypto card and pays the provider
Or uses x402 to complete an on-chain settlement flow
Dashboard updates balance, renewal date, and spend insights.
